# http-from-tcp

A follow-along project from _Learn the HTTP Protocol_ course from ThePrimeagen https://www.boot.dev/teachers/the-primeagen.
What a great course.

Also added some more functionalities like:
- API request routing with dynamic routes
- panic recover
- handle request in concurrently (goroutine pool)
